name: "Studying biomarkers of Parkinson's Disese"

description: "<p> Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder distinguished by the collection of
deformed alpha-synuclein aggregates (Lewy bodies) and breakdown in the mesencephalon
and basal ganglia. A key challenge in PD research is the deficiency of secure biomarkers that
provide proof-of-mechanism or proof-of-concept in clinical trials. Even though over 147
ongoing PD trials, including 56 analyzing disease-modifying therapies, disease improvement
is essentially evaluated through clinical rating scales like MDS-UPDRS or Hoehn and Yahr,
which lack molecular specificity. We analyze this gap by uncovering and modeling
biomarkers linked to PD mechanisms to refine early diagnosis, track disease growth, and
improve therapeutic evaluation."
