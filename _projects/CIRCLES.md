description: "<p>We aim to improve the future of transportation and advance the convergence of artificial intelligence, simulation, traffic engineering, and vehicle technology in the context of mixed human-autonomous traffic. â€“ <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X18301517?via%3Dihub">Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies</a>. </p>
<p>The Piccoli lab develops control algorithms based on the mean field limit of microscopic traffic models. This leads to models of ODEs and PDEs that are the basis for optimal control problems designed to minimize the energy usage.
