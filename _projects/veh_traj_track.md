name: "Fast and Accurate Detection and Tracking of Vehicles for Trajectory Extraction"

description: "<p> Accurate vehicle trajectory information is the backbone on which modern traffic flow models are built and is also useful for appraising the effects of next-generation transportation technologies and methods on the stability of traffic flow. This work seeks to provide an accurate, real-time source for vehicle trajectory information by leveraging computer vision algorithms to process information from a camera sensor network. Current work seeks to accelerate existing methods for 3D object detection and multi-object tracking to real-time processing speeds. Additional work will include intelligently handling object occlusions and re-identifying objects in images from different camera views.</p>"
