name: "Modeling metabolic systems via Linear-In-Flux-Expressions (LIFE)"

description: "<p>We have designed a framework for modeling systems of biochemical reactions. Our research addresses the foundation of modeling complex reactions (between three or more molecules) and the capability of a drug to inhibit or enhance fluxes in the system. We introduce the concept of metabolic graphs, a generalization of hypergraphs having specialized features common to metabolic networks; these features are visualizations of the framework that corresponds to complex reaction dynamics and drug inhibition or enhancement.
</p>

<p>LIFE utilizes the flux space at equilibrium to reduce the total number model parameters. This allows one to impose the equilibrium structure of the model while exploring the sensitivity of the network to perturbations, such as drug treatment or illness. We have developed simulations to implement these tools, allowing us to analyze metabolic response to drug treatment. This is valuable to quantitative systems pharmacology, since combination treatment is time consuming and expensive to perform many experiments corresponding to the many potential combinations of drugs.
