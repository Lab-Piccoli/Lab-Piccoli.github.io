description: "<p>Joint traffic state estimation and incident detection is a critical problem for both traffic monitoring and highway safety. In this project, multiple model filtering techniques (e.g., particle filter and Kalman filter) and macroscopic traffic flow models are proposed to jointly estimate the traffic state and detect traffic incidents in real-time using sensor data. The algorithms are tested through incident data generated by a microscopic traffic simulation software (CORSIM) and field data collected from the mobile century experiment by Berkeley, 2008. The left figure shows the traffic density evolution from a CORSIM simulation, where the red area in the plot indicates the traffic congestion caused by an incident.</p>"
