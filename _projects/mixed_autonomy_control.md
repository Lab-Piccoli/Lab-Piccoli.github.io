description: "<p>Increasingly the make-up of traffic includes vehicles with partially autonomous features, usch as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). While it has been shown that careful control of autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic can smooth traffic instabilities caused by human drivers, it has also been shown that currently available ACCs can fall victim to the same instabilities.</p>
