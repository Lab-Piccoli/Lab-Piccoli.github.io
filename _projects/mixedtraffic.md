description: "<p> Real-world traffic is often comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of vehicle types (cars, trucks, SUVs, etc.) on multi-lane roads that allow lane changing; in real-world scenarios, stop-and-go waves appear affecting the efficiency of travel. It is often difficult to model such real-world systems due to the heterogeneous nature of the traffic, with different vehicle dynamics depending on vehicle type. These dynamics affect how the vehicle drives on the road and how different vehicle types interact. We create a traffic simulator for mixed, car-truck traffic on multi-lane roads with lane changing. Each vehicle follows Bando-Follow The Leader dynamics, with lane-changing behavior depending on safety and incentive conditions. The simulator allows the introduction of control vehicles into traffic to prevent the formation or dissipate existing stop-and-go waves. </p>"
