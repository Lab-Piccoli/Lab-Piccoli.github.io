name: "Traffic flow implecations of autonomous and partially autonomous vehicles"

description: "<p>While it may be a long time before all the vehicles on our roadways are completely automated (if ever), it is likely that in the near future there will be an increasing number of autonomous (or partially autonomous) vehicles. These vehicles will likely drive somewhat differently than human drivers, and will thus influence the traffic dynamics. Similar to the shift from Eularian to Lagrangian traffic state estimation that occured when GPS-enabled smartphones entered the mainstream, a similar shift from Eularian control (control at fixed locations in the infrastructure, e.g., ramp meetering) to Lagrangian control in the traffic flow may be possible, even with just a small number of autonomous vehicles in the traffic that can be controlled to control the overall traffic flow.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to identify the extent to which a small number of autonomous vehicles in the traffic flow (e.g., 5% of vehicles) are able to alter the traffic dynamics and mitigate adverse emergent phonomena such as traffic osscilations or phantom traffic jams. The work includes both theoretical contributions on traffic stability as well as extensive experimental work demonstrating the ability of a single autonomous vehicle in a flow of 20 human-piloted vehicles to completely eliminate traffic instabilities reducing overall fuel consumption by nearly 40%.</p>
