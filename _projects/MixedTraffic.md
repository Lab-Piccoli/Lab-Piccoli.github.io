name: "Mixed traffic simulator"

description: "<p>Real world traffic is often comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of vehicle types (cars, trucks, SUVs, etc.) on multi-lane roads that allows lane changing; in real-world scenarios, stop-and-go waves appear affecting the efficiency of travel. It is often difficult to model such real-world systems due to the heterogenous nature of the traffic, with different vehicle dynamics depending on the vehicle type - even expanding to vehicle interaction types. We create a traffic simulator for mixed, car-truck traffic on multi-lane roads with lane changing. Each vehicle is follows Bando-FTL dynamics, with lane changing behaviour depending on safety and incentive conditions. The simulator gives the opportunity to introduce "control vehicles" into traffic in an attempt to prevent the formation or dissipate existing stop-and-go waves.</p>"
