name: "Improving intelligent transportation systems (ITS) in safety-critical environments"

description: "<p>The enormous and rapidly increasing amount of traffic data opens tremendous opportunities for the development of intelligent transportation systems. However, real time traffic estimation and optimal traffic management in safety critical environments are still open problems. One example occurs in rural work zones, where existing sensor coverage is sparse.</p>
<p>Our work aims at improving ITS in safety-critical situations via: <em>i)</em> the development of a low-cost and low-power wireless sensor network for traffic monitoring in work zones; <em>ii)</em> the development of mathematical traffic models on networks for amenable for optimal traffic management. In this work, a low-cost and low-power wireless traffic sensor platform is built using the passive infrared camera and machine learning algorithms to detect vehicles and estimate the traffic speed. Concurrently, we are developing a theoretical framework traffic estimation and optimal traffic management for networks of conservation laws. The developed sensor network, a variety of traffic estimation algorithms (including ensemble Kalman filter and Particle filter), and the optimal traffic management (using convex programs) are simulated and validated in micro-simulation environment.</p>"
