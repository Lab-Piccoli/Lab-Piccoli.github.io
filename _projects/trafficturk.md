description: "<p>TrafficTurk is a mobile application that allows easy collection of traffic data.  The app functions as a turning movement counter - the user stands at an intersection and swipes the screen when a vehicle passes.  The user swipes the trajectory of the car on an intersection image - different types of swipes correspond to various types  of turns.  All of these turns are sent wirelessly to a central server in realtime, so they can be analyzed and stored in a database. The purpose of TrafficTurk is to collect data on a large scale during unusual events. Ideally, many users will simultaneously collect data at nearby intersections in order to get a complete picture of the traffic patterns.  The server sends a map to the app, allowing users to scroll around and see various intersections.  They choose the one that they intend to collect data at, and begin counting. TrafficTurk is designed for the worst-case scenario.  During some types of unusual events, mobile networks become crowded or even fail entirely.  For this reason, the app must be able to function with intermittent or absent internet connections.  To support this, the app can easily pre-cache all of the intersections in an area.  In this way, it is possible to count at these intersections even if there are no mobile networks available near them.  Similarly, the app maintains a cache of collected data which only clears once the server has received it.  In this way, the app has a 100% data collection guarantee as long as the phone eventually connects to a wireless network.</p>"
