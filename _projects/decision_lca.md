name: "Decision Making with Data Uncertainty in Life Cycle Assessment"

description: "<p>In life cycle assessment, when product systems are optimized to minimize environmental impacts, uncertainty in the process data may impact optimal decisions. In this project, a robust optimization approach is proposed for decision making under uncertainty at the life cycle inventory stage. The level of protection against data uncertainty can be controlled to reflect varying degrees of conservatism. The left figure shows the comparison between the proposed robust optimization approach (red) and deterministic optimization approach (blue) in terms of carbon oxygen output for an electricity generation problem with varying degrees of protection against data uncertainty.</p>"
