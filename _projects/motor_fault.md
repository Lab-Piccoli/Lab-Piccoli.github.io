name: "Electric motor failure classification"

description: "<p>Predictive maintenance of machinery has recently become a higher-performance methodology compared to traditional condition-based maintenance. This is due to improved sensing capabilities through the internet of things (IoT) and renewed interest in machine learning methods that perform diagnosis well. Fault states as well as machine health values can be predicted in some cases.</p>
<p>We are interested in classifying electric motor failure conditions using accelerometer data, with specific application for traction motors on railroad locomotives. Machine learning classifiers were first trained and tested on motor data from a test bench to make the binary prediction of faulty or healthy condition. Ensemble models were then developed to make the multi-label classification of which fault, or which combination of fault, are present in a motor.</p>"
