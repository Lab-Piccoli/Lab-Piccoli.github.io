name: "Ovarian Cancer Outcome Predition"

description: "<p>Ovarian cancer is a multifaceted disease that requires a comprehensive approach for early detection and treatment. One such question is understanding how the cancer antigen (CA-125) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) can be a useful prognostic biomarker. We address this by trying to determine if cfDNA can be used to create a longitudinal modeled kinetic parameter score for determining patients' response as well as prognosis. This model will help us study and better understand the role of cfDNA, as an added parameter in KELIM, as a prognostic biomarker for ovarian cancer patients.</p>"
