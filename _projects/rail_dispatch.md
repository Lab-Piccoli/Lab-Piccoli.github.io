description: "<p>We have written a mixed integer linear optimization model that dispatches trains according to signaling constraints on single track railway lines with passing sidings and does so optimally according to the minimization of a weighted delay measure.</p>
<p>This concept is similar to that used in commercial computer-aided dispatching systems, but those systems have the notable shortcoming of being overridden often in areas with complex dispatching situations. That is, they do not match the behavior of human dispatchers well. I propose to remedy this problem by performing inverse optimization according to known historical data for single track rail lines.</p>
<p>Specifically, the forward optimization problem (dispatching trains) can be tuned to match historical dispatching behavior as closely as possible. The resulting dispatching model is a useful simulation tool that could be used for prediction of train arrivals, assessment of dispatching performance, investigation of track infrastructure layout, and schedule optimization.</p>"
