name: "Traffic State Estimations for Heterogeneous Traffic Flows"

description: "<p>Cities today are faced with finding new solutions to provide access and mobility while
simultaneously reducing the environmental and congestion-related impacts caused by our
transportation services. At the same time, a new generation of mobility service providers are introducing shared fleets of dockless bikes, bikes with electric assist (e-bikes), and electric scooters
that are now sharing the same infrastructure as pedestrians and motorists. Combined, this emerging
collection of vehicle types with different performance and size attributes are interacting and
creating a highly heterogeneous flow of traffic for which limited models and traffic management
strategies exist.
<p>The main goal of this project is to investigate the ability of recently developed heterogeneous traffic flow models to capture the increasingly sophisticated features of urban traffic streams. Estimation algorithms will be developed to assess the model capabilities when combined with streaming data using nonlinear estimation techniques such as the particle filter.  Additionally, analysis from model implementations will provide insights on transportation planning and management strategies that are most suitable for todayâ€™s urban traffic complexity.
