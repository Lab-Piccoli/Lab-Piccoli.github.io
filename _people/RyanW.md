description: I am currently a graduate student in the CCIB program at Rutgers Universityâ€“Camden. Both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees are in pure mathematics from Rutgers. I have been a student at Rutgers since Fall 2014 and PTL at Rutgers since Spring 2019, teaching 100 level courses for the Math Department. I decided to try out the research world in Fall 2020 both completing a thesis in pure math and working on computational projects for Dr. Piccoli's Lab. I found the research projects very fun and interesting, so I asked to stay and they said yes! <a href="rjw163@scarletmail.rutgers.edu">Email Me</a>
