description: My Ph. D. is in computational biology and background is in pure mathematics; I have a Bachelor’s from Virginia Polytechnic Institute. I nearly finished a master’s degree in mathematics when I joined the Center for Integrative and Computational Biology (CCIB) at Rutgers Camden. I am driven to play a significant role in scientific research; this guided my decision to leave the master’s program and join the CCIB as a Ph. D. student. In the CCIB, I’ve gained experience using mathematical modeling techniques on metabolic networks and vehicular traffic, and I use simulations and control theory to analyze these models.<a href="mailto:sn.mcquade@gmail.com">Email Me</a>
