description: I am Precious Akinde, a masters student at CCIB. My background is in Biology and I got my Bachelors of Science in Biology at Alcorn State University, Mississippi. I developed interest in computational biology during the time of me working as a clinical lab operator at a biotechnology company after graduation as most of the tools that processed our data/patients' results were computational. I am currently working on creating a mathematical model for an ovarian cancer project. Fun fact about me is that I love good food, so I enjoy cooking, trying new recipes and exploring restaurants!
