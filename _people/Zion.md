description: I am a master's student in the Center for Computational and Integrative Biology (CCIB) at
Rutgers Universityâ€“Camden. I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from Lincoln University of
Pennsylvania. My academic interests lie at the intersection of computer science, biology, and
public health, with a focus on using computational tools to address real-world health challenges.
My current research involves developing an epidemiological model to monitor HPV-related
cancers across the state of New Jersey. The goal of this work is to provide data-driven insights
that can support public health officials and policymakers in improving vaccination strategies and
outreach efforts for HPV prevention.
