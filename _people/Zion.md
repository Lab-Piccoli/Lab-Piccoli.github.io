description: I am currently a graduate student in the CCIB M.S. program at Rutgers University - Camden. My Bachelor's degree is in pure mathematics from the Pennsylvania State University. I have experience as an undergraduate teaching assistant in biological mathematics courses and decided to pursue research in applied mathematics upon completion of my undergraduate degree. Applying my mathematical background to biological studies has been quite rewarding and I look forward to continuing my work in the Piccoli lab. <a href="mailto:acd210@scarletmail.rutgers.edu">Email Me</a>
