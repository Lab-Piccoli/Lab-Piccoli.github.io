description: I am currently a graduate student at the Masters level in the CCIB program of Rutgers-Camden. My bachelor is in Molecular and Cellular Biology from the University of Science and Technology-Zewail City in Egypt. My last couple of years at the bachelor, I fell in love with mathematics and physics. And I was amazed by how mathematics is a miraculous tool used to model everything around us. I then made the decision to pursue a career where I have to be involved in the mathematical modeling of biological problems. My work at the lab is about chronobiology; specifically developing models that would offer us understanding of how our circadian clocks entrain (synchronize) themselves to periodic environmental stimuli such as light and temperature. It is quite exciting to figure out how to create such a model, and to overcome such a challenge.
