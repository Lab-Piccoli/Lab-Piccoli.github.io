description: I am currently a junior at Rutgers working on dual bachelorâ€™s degrees in Chemistry and Philosophy. I am a transfer student from Rowan College at Burlington County with an associates in liberal arts & sciences and studied many areas of knowledge. I have always had interest in mathematics and problem solving and love many areas of STEM and want to continue to develop skills in these areas throughout life. I also would like to continue on to graduate schools for science and engineering to learn even more on the systems that control how the world functions and research its properties. After education itself I would like to use these skills to work with research and development throughout my life. The main drive to do this is in hopes of researching answering questions that we do not now know, and to also develop things that will help the planet and society for generations to come.
