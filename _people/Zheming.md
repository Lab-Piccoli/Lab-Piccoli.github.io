description: I finished my M.S. and Ph.D. in Dr. Piccoli's lab in biomathematics. I have a Bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University, China. I am interested in the interdisciplinary study of applied mathematics and complex biological systems. My primary research focuses on the use of different mathematical tools, including ordinary differential equation-based models, statistical models, graph theory, and control theory, to study the entrainment mechanisms of circadian systems, human metabolic networks, and forensic DNA interpretation process. Currently, I am motivated to work at the juncture of systems biology, control theory, and AI. My current postion is as a postdoctoral fellow in Professor Eduardo Sontag's lab at Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA.
