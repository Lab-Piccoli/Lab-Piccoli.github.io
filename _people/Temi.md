description: I am currently a master's student in the Computational and Integrative Biology program at Rutgers Camden. My Bachelor's degree is in Industrial Chemistry from Covenant University, Ota, Nigeria. In my second year of undergraduate, I discovered my interest in solving problems using mathematical methods. Since we had a different education system, it was hard for me to switch programs. The CCIB program has given me the opportunity to explore my interest in mathematics. Working on COVID-19 has changed my perspective on mathematics and shown me how important the subject is in the health sciences.  <a href="mailto:tfa20@scarletmail.rutgers.edu">Email Me</a>
