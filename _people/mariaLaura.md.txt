description: I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at University of California, Berkeley. Prior to joining UC Berkeley, I was a research scientist at Inria Grenoble – Rhône Alpes (France). From 2014 to 2016, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Rutgers University – Camden, NJ (USA) in Dr. Piccoli's group. My research lies at the intersection of engineering and mathematics.  It is aimed at designing more sustainable communities using new models and control strategies that leverage the latest technologies to improve the energy footprint and resilience of transportation systems. I am interested in mathematical modeling, numerical approximation, and control of traffic flow applications.
