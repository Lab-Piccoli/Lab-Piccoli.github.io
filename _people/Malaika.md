description: I am a sophomore pursuing a B.S. in Biology with a minor in chemistry and a concentration in mathematics. Currently I am serving as President of Student Wellness Advisory Board, Vice President of Psychology Club, and Public Relations Representative for Biology Club. Along with this, I am a research assistant for the CIRCLES Project, where I am tasked with planning and organizing various scenarios related to the experiments. This wonderful opportunity has given me a chance to gain research experience first hand, and work with many different kinds of scientists. After graduation, my goal is to attend graduate school to obtain my PhD in neuroscience.
