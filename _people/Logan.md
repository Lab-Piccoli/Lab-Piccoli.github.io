description: I am currently a graduate student in the Mathematics department at Rutgers University-Camden. My Bachelor's degree is in Applied Mathematics at Texas State University. I have been a PTL since Fall 2021, and I am currently working in the Math and Stats Lab. I have experience applying discrete mathematics and CS concepts to studying higher level Algebra and PDEs. I am currently pursuing research that applies the same concepts to biological systems for Dr. Picolli's Lab. I am particularly interested in applying algebra to study complicated structures in various fields. Specifically, I am interested in Vertex Operator Algebras for studying Physics, Homotopy Type Theory for studying Theoretical CS, and various Graph Theory extensions for studying Biological Systems in Dr. Picolli's Lab.
