description:I am currently a graduate student in the Mathematics department at Rutgers University-Camden. My Bachelor's degree is in Pure Math and Physics from Colgate University. I have been a TA since Fall 2021 and will be a PTL in Fall 2022. I also work in the Math and Stats Lab. I have experience applying pure math such as number theory and algebra to solve linear algebra questions. I am researching traffic models for Dr. Picolli’s lab using PDE’s and in particular, comparing how the model we have compares to existing models. My interests lie primarily in Algebraic number theory although I am also interested in topological dynamical systems.
