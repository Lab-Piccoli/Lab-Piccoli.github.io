description: Currently I am a Sophomore working towards earning a bachelor's degree in the Computer Science major at Rutgers Camden. Prior to college enrollment I attended the Atlantic County Institute of Technology under the Engineering, Math and Sciences academy that gave experience when working with higher level projects. During my attendance at rutgers I have managed to be a part of the Honors college and maintain an internship position that has the responsibility of planning the logistics/modifying certain algorithms regarding the ambitious CIRCLES project. After earning my computer science degree I plan to pursue a career in development of digital entertainment or be able to work in a position that allows me to hone my programming skills.
