description: I am currently a Master's student in the CCIB program at Rutgers University-Camden. Prior to joining CCIB, I received my Bachelor's degree in Biomathematics from Rutgers University-New Brunswick. During my time as an undergraduate, I developed a strong interest in the integration of mathematics and biology, mainly dynamic systems in biology. I've always been fascinated by the potential for using computational approaches in this world of genetics, and I am eager to learn more about this exciting and rapidly-evolving field. My goal for the future is to acquire more computational abilities in order to have a significant impact in the field, whether it be through research, industry, or academia. I am excited to continue this journey in the Piccoli lab during the spring. <a href="mailto:christopher.murray.2022@gmail.com ">Email Me</a>
