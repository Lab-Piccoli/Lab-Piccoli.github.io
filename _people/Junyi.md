description: I am a PhD student at Vanderbilt University with Prof. Dan Work and a member of the I-24 MOTION testbed team. I-24 MOTION is an instrument designed to fully and simultaneously capture the movement of particles and waves, providing unique insights into dynamic systems. I am always fascinated by large-scale systems and empirical data. I work closely with Dr. Piccoli on stop-and-go traffic waves, drawing inspiration from his expertise, wisdom and unique perspective to develop innovative computational methods.
