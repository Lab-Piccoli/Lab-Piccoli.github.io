description: "<p>William Barbour is research scientist the Institute for Software Integrated Systems at Vanderbilt University. His studies have been interdisciplinary, with a Ph.D. in civil engineering from Vanderbilt University, an M.S. degree in sustainable and resilient infrastructure systems from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and a B.S. in Biosystems Engineering from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Dr. Barbour has previously worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and CSX Transportation. He has also received graduate funding support from the Roadway Safety Institute and Federal Highway Administration.</p>
<p>William’s career and research interests focus on the application of novel and advanced computational techniques to transportation systems engineering; examples include big data analytics, machine learning, optimization, and artificial intelligence. He has applied these interests in the freight rail transportation domain through ongoing industry collaboration with Class I railroads, where improvements in network operations can lead to capacity and efficiency gains for the system. William’s other domain interests include pedestrian and cyclist accessibility, public transit planning, and transportation policy.</p>
<p>In addition to research, William teaches with Vanderbilt Programs for Talented Youth. In summer 2019, he planned and taught two sections of his new class, Sensors and Big Data Analysis, to gifted high school students from across the United States and abroad at the Vanderbilt Summer Academy. The class included hands-on experiences for students in sensor prototyping, data collection, and data analysis. An abbreviated version of the class will be taught again in fall 2019 at the Weekend at Vanderbilt University program."
