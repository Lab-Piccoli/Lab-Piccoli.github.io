description: I am currently a PhD student in Dr. Piccoli's lab at Rutgers Camden. My Bachelor's degree is in Computational Mathematics from the Pennsylvania State University. I have always enjoyed the intersection of math and computer science, with some of my past areas of interest being applied cryptography and automation. I've recently discovered how fulfilling applying my math background to real-world problems can be in the Piccoli Lab.  <a href="mailto:cad373@scarletmail.rutgers.edu">Email Me</a>
