I am currently a graduate student in the Mathematics program at Rutgers Camden. My Bachelor's degree is in Computational Mathematics from the Pennsylvania State University. I have always enjoyed the intersection of math and computer science, with some of my past areas of interest being applied cryptography and automation. I've recently discovered how fulfilling applying my math background to real-world problems can be while working as a research assistant in the Piccoli Lab. Next fall, I will begin working towards a PhD in the CCIB program at Rutgers Camden.
