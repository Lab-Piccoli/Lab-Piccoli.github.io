description: I am a graduate student in the CCIB program at Rutgers University–Camden, conducting research in Dr. Piccoli’s lab. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry and Biotechnology and am passionate about merging biology and mathematics to address real-world challenges. In my research at Dr. Piccoli’s lab, I apply mathematical modeling to investigate complex biological systems, focusing on diseases such as cancer and Parkinson’s. I am also exploring factors influencing AI adoption in healthcare. Through this work, I have developed a deep fascination with the intersection of mathematics and biology, using quantitative approaches to gain novel insights into biological processes. Beyond my research, I enjoy caring for my beloved cats, whose companionship brings joy and balance.
