description: I completed my PhD in 2017 in Dr. Piccoli’s lab, on mathematical models for pattern formation in biological systems. Before that, I got my master’s degree in Applied Mathematics from ENSTA ParisTech and Sorbonne University (Paris). After graduating from Rutgers University (Camden), I moved back to France and became a postdoctoral fellow with Francesco Salvarani, at University Paris-Dauphine. Since 2018, I have been a permanent researcher at Inria Paris and Sorbonne University. My research focuses on developing and studying mathematical models for large systems of interacting particles. I aim to explain pattern formation from a mathematical perspective, using tools such as asymptotic analysis or control theory. I am particularly interested in the various ways of deriving macroscopic limits of microscopic systems (mean-field, graph limit). I also continue to develop models for biological systems in close collaboration with biologists, specifically in the areas of developmental biology and cell-fate transition.
