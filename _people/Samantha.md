description: I am currently a graduate student in the Applied Mathematics program at Rutgers University, Camden. I hold a Bachelors of Science in Music Education from Gettysburg College and a Masters of Music from Temple University. I have a passion for education, working as a part-time lecturer and teachers assistant here at Rutgers, with plans to teach in the near future. I hope to pursue a PhD in Mathematics Education , exploring how research in cognitive development and cross-curricular knowledge can better inform teaching in the mathematics classroom.
