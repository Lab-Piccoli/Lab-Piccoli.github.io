<p>The MegaVander Test was the largest open track live traffic autonomous vehicle experiment to date. The CIRCLES Consortium, consisting of Vanderbilt University, UC Berkeley, Temple University and Rutgers University-Camden, in coordination with Nissan North America and the Tennessee Department of Transportation, performed this five-day experiment from Nov. 14 through Nov. 18 2022.

	Researchers collected data on a sensor filled portion of I-24 consisting of hundreds of cameras and 100 Nissan Rouges equipped with their own dash and rear view cameras as well as data collection devices. In each car, novel adaptations to the assisted cruise control systems were made in order to run a controller with the hope of smoothing traffic waves and minimizing feul consumption.
