	<h1>MegaVander Test</h1>
</header>






<p>The MegaVander Test was the largest open track live traffic autonomous vehicle experiment to date.

	The CIRCLES Consortium, consisting of Vanderbilt University, UC Berkeley, Temple University and Rutgers University-Camden, in coordination with Nissan North America and the Tennessee Department of Transportation, performed this five-day experiment from Nov. 14 through Nov. 18 2022. 
	
  </p>


<p>
	Researchers collected data on a sensor filled portion of I-24 consisting of hundreds of highway cameras installed to collect traffic data.

	100 Nissan Rouges were equipped with their own dash and rear view cameras as well as data collection devices in order to monitor the experiment. 
	
	In each car, novel adaptations to the assisted cruise control systems were made in order to run a controller with the hope of smoothing traffic waves and minimizing feul consumption.

Nearly 200 drivers were hired to drive the vehicles and implement the adaptive cruise control during test days.
