Undergraduate researchers Caroline Janssen, Ricardo Sandoval, and Caleb Van Geffen present posters from their summer research at the Vanderbilt School of Engineering Summer Research Poster Session.

The project that Caroline presented surveyed legislation regarding micromobility in Nashville and its peer cities, plus how that legislation devoloped over time. Ricardo and Caleb's project analyzed trips made on shared e-scooters in Nashville to identify high-density areas of trip endpoints that may be suitable for upgrades in parking infrastructure. Both summer projects resulted in conference papers.
