Professor Work is leading Vanderbilt's participation in a $5.2 million (total) grant from the US Department of Transportation. The research will seek to improve the effectiveness of integrated corridor management (ICM) systems like the ongoing I-24 Smart Corridor project. The I-24 corridor is a critical part of Nashville's growing congestion and forms the critical link to Murfreesboro. A variety of ICM strategies are being deployed on the corridor, such as dynamic message signs, changeable speed limits, ramp metering, V2X communication, and more.

The project will be supported by a multidisciplinary team: Craig Philip, director of the Vanderbilt Center for Transportation and Operational Resiliency (VECTOR); Janos Sztipanovits, director of the Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS); and Eric Hall, staff engineer at ISIS.
