Each year, the [Eno Future Leaders Development Conference](https://www.enotrans.org/course/future-leaders-development-conference/) (LDC) gives 20 of the nation’s top graduate students in transportation a first-hand look at how national transportation policies are developed. Students apply to the program early in the year, and those selected as “Eno Fellows” come to Washington, DC for a week in the spring of meetings with federal officials and leaders of business and non-profit organizations.

William Barbour has been selected by the Board of Regents of the Eno Center for Transportation to participate in the 26th annual Eno Future Leaders Development Conference in Washington, DC, May 20th – 25th.
