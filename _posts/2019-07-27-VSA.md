Topics in sensor deployments, smart cities, and data analysis were taught by PhD student Will Barbour at the Vanderbilt Summer Academy in his designed course, "Sensors and Big Data Analysis". Will had the opportunity to teach gifted high school students from across the United States and abroad during four weeks of class and 120 hours of instruction. Students learned about electrical engineering and building their own sensor prototypes, programming microcontrollers for data collection and control tasks, and data analysis techniques in spreadsheets and Python.
