The [Gilbreth Lectures](https://www.nae.edu/Activities/Projects/31202.aspx) were established in 2001 by the Council of the National Academy of Engineering as a means of recognizing outstanding young American engineers and making them more visible to the NAE membership. Recipients of the lectureships are nominated from the Frontiers of Engineering program and are named in honor of Lillian Gilbreth, the first woman elected to the National Academy of Engineering (1965) and a pioneer in the field of Human Factors.
