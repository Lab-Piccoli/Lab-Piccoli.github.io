Student Raphael Stern has successfully defended his dissertation titled, “Impacts of vehicle automation on traffic flow stability” on October 26, 2018. The dissertation demonstrated that even a small number of autonomous vehicles are capable of smoothing traffic flow and dampening traffic waves if properly controlled. After graduation, Raphael will be joining the faculty at the University of Minnesota in September, 2019 as an assistant professor in the department of Civil, Environmental, and Geo- Engineering.
