Professor Work, Will Barbour, and Caroline Janssen present excerpts from their research on autonomous vehicles and micromobility data analytics and policy to the delegates from the Kansas City Chamber of Commerce that were visiting Nashville and Vanderbilt. Along with Mark Abkowitz, Janey Camp, Erin Hafkenschiel, and Craig Philip, the session also covered infrastructure resiliency and Vanderbilt's efforts to improve transportation and mobility options on campus.
