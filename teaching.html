<div class="quote_item"><em>&#8220;It takes these very simple-minded instructions. &#8216;Go fetch a number, add it to this number, put the result there, perceive if it&#8217;s greater than this other number,&#8217; but executes them at a rate of, let&#8217;s say, 1,000,000 per second. At 1,000,000 per second, the results appear to be magic.&#8221;</em> – Steve Jobs, 1985.</div>
<p>In the 30+ years since Jobs proclaimed the &#8220;magic&#8221; of computing, it is easy to see its influence throughout society. Yet, the number of students who see the beauty and criticality of computing in civil engineering, and dedicate themselves to careers in this area, is vastly inadequate to support this national imperative. Moreover, driven by a crowded planet and finite resources, linking computing with the civil infrastructure may hold the key to increasing sustainability and resilience of the built environment. My<b> </b>educational activities at Vanderbilt are motivated by the<b> </b>critical need to increase computational skills within civil engineering<b> </b>because it is vital to understand computing in order to develop meaningful solutions to some of the most complex challenges facing society.</p>

<h2>Courses Taught at Vanderbilt</h2>
<p><strong>CE 3501 Transportation Systems Engineering</strong></p>
<p>This course provides an introduction to the planning, design and operations of transportation systems. Fundamental analysis and design concepts for transportation systems are introduced. This class will help students (1) become familiar with transportation engineering and most planning and engineering design problems in this context; and (2) apply the methodologies introduced in this course to solve transportation engineering problems. Examples from connected and autonomous vehicles are introduced.
