<div class="quote_item"><em>&#8220;It takes these very simple-minded instructions. &#8216;Go fetch a number, add it to this number, put the result there, perceive if it&#8217;s greater than this other number,&#8217; but executes them at a rate of, let&#8217;s say, 1,000,000 per second. At 1,000,000 per second, the results appear to be magic.&#8221;</em> – Steve Jobs, 1985.</div>
<p>In the 30+ years since Jobs proclaimed the &#8220;magic&#8221; of computing, it is easy to see its influence throughout society. Yet, the number of students who see the beauty and criticality of computing in civil engineering, and dedicate themselves to careers in this area, is vastly inadequate to support this national imperative. Moreover, driven by a crowded planet and finite resources, linking computing with the civil infrastructure may hold the key to increasing sustainability and resilience of the built environment. My<b> </b>educational activities at Vanderbilt are motivated by the<b> </b>critical need to increase computational skills within civil engineering<b> </b>because it is vital to understand computing in order to develop meaningful solutions to some of the most complex challenges facing society.</p>

<h2>Courses Taught at Rutgers</h2>
<p><strong>50–640–466 MATH METHODS IN SYSTEM BIOLOGY I </strong></p>
<p> The course provides an introduction to mathematical methods for systems biology. In particular linear algebra, probability, theories of networks (graph theory), difference and ordinary differential equations will be developed as tools to address a wide set of biological and biomedical applications. The latter will range from classical prey-predator populations examples to biological networks.

<p><strong>50–640–466 MATH METHODS IN SYSTEM BIOLOGY II </strong></p>
<p>The course MMBSII focuses on advanced mathematical methods, which are of particular relevance for biological systems. Building up on MMBS I, the course will further develop the theory of ordinary differential equations, dealing with equilibrium analysis, phase portraits, Lyapunov stability and control theory. Then links between properties of networks and systems of ODEs will be explored. Some advanced topics, such as random graphs and/or social dynamics are also treated.
