Our research projects explore the interplay between autonomous vehicles and phantom traffic jams. We also use large mobility datasets to understand urban traffic congestion at city scales, and freight rail traffic at the regional scale.

&lt;p&gt;The project that Caroline presented surveyed legislation regarding micromobility in Nashville and its peer cities, plus how that legislation devoloped over time. Ricardo and Caleb’s project analyzed trips made on shared e-scooters in Nashville to identify high-density areas of trip endpoints that may be suitable for upgrades in parking infrastructure. Both summer projects resulted in conference papers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Undergraduate researchers present posters on their summer projects.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://lab-work.github.io/images/VUSE_posters_combined.png" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Vanderbilt Summer Academy</title><link href="https://lab-work.github.io/blog/VSA/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Vanderbilt Summer Academy" /><published>2019-07-27T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-07-27T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://lab-work.github.io/blog/VSA</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lab-work.github.io/blog/VSA/">&lt;p&gt;Topics in sensor deployments, smart cities, and data analysis were taught by PhD student Will Barbour at the Vanderbilt Summer Academy in his designed course, “Sensors and Big Data Analysis”. Will had the opportunity to teach gifted high school students from across the United States and abroad during four weeks of class and 120 hours of instruction. Students learned about electrical engineering and building their own sensor prototypes, programming microcontrollers for data collection and control tasks, and data analysis techniques in spreadsheets and Python.&lt;/p&gt;

The work details the process for constructing an automated data reconciliation pipeline from any optimization-based dispatching model. This allows for the identification and correction of infeasible dispatching data at the network scale, which is a difficult and costly task even at small scales.&lt;/p&gt;
