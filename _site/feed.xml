Our research projects explore the interplay between autonomous vehicles and phantom traffic jams. We also use large mobility datasets to understand urban traffic congestion at city scales, and freight rail traffic at the regional scale. We also build mathematical models and systems theory tools to understand the underlying behavior of traffic flow.</subtitle><entry><title type="html">NeurIPS 2019 Workshop - Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning</title><link href="https://lab-work.github.io/blog/NIPS2019/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="NeurIPS 2019 Workshop - Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning" /><published>2019-12-14T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-12-14T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://lab-work.github.io/blog/NIPS2019</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lab-work.github.io/blog/NIPS2019/">&lt;p&gt;Ph.D. students Yue Hu and Yangbing Wang presented at NeurIPS 2019 Workshop - Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning on Dec. 14 2019. They presented their work on automatic data cleaning for urban sensor networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low cost urban sensing networks enhance our understanding of cites and urban life. IThe impacts of mitigation strategies in communities can be measured at a fine-grained scale, informing context-aware policies and infrastructure design. However, fine-grained city-scale data analysis is complicated by common, tedious data cleaning tasks such as removing outliers and imputing missing data. To address the challenge of data cleaning, this project applies robust low-rank tensor factorization method to automatically correct anomalies and impute missing entries for high-dimensional urban environmental datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method is applied to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arrayofthings.github.io/&quot;&gt;Array of Things (AoT)&lt;/a&gt; city-scale sensor network. Located in the City of Chicago, IL, AoT collects real time data on the city’s environment and activity with more than 90 nodes. Further analysis of AoT data and its broader usages are also under way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Yue Hu and Yanbing Wang presented at NuerIPS 2019 workshop on Automatic Data Cleaning for Urban Sensor Networks.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://lab-work.github.io/images/NIPS2019.JPG" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Future of Urban Transportation</title><link href="https://lab-work.github.io/blog/VU-magazine/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Future of Urban Transportation" /><published>2019-10-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-10-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://lab-work.github.io/blog/VU-magazine</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lab-work.github.io/blog/VU-magazine/">&lt;p&gt;A recent article in Vanderbilt Magazine, by award-winning writer Stephen Ornes, featured interviews from Prof. Dan Work, Ph.D. student Will Barbour, and their colleages from Vanderbilt and VECTOR.

Will had the opportunity to teach gifted high school students from across the United States and abroad during four weeks of class and 120 hours of instruction. Students learned about electrical engineering and building their own sensor prototypes, programming microcontrollers for data collection and control tasks, and data analysis techniques in spreadsheets and Python.&lt;/p&gt;

The work details the process for constructing an automated data reconciliation pipeline from any optimization-based dispatching model. This allows for the identification and correction of infeasible dispatching data at the network scale, which is a difficult and costly task even at small scales.&lt;/p&gt;
